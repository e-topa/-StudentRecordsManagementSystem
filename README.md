# -StudentRecordsManagementSystem
Student Records Management System with Git version control. Store, manage, and report on student data collaboratively.

Welcome to the Student Records Management System project! This repository is designed to store and manage detailed student information using a database.

## First Merge Update:
We've successfully completed the first merge, and I'd like to commend Adesanya Iyanu for the excellent work on the UI. 

### Feedback on UI:
I've reviewed the changes, and it's looking good so far. However, there are a few areas that need completion. Specifically, the add form should be implemented to reflect on the second UI.
Great job on the UI! 👍 I'm excited about the progress and looking forward to seeing the final result. Keep up the good work! 😊
